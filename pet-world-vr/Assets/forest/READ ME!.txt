Thank you for purchasing Hand painted Forest pack!

In order to replicate the look of the screenshots and videos please do the following:

Download the post processing stack from the asset store:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/post-processing-stack-83912

There is a camera profile (Forest/Camera_profile) that you can add to your camera (add a post process behavior component), all the effects are already set up for you.

The character is fully rigged and is compatible with unity third person controller.
You can animate the mouth and the eyes have 4 different "states" which you can chose by offsetting the eyes texture by 0/0.25/0.5/0.75 

You can download the toon shader form the unity standard assets (Toon/ Basic outline) and set the eyes material to mobile/particles/alpha belnded
Add the shader toon cube map to the cube map slot.(Forest/character/)

Enjoy,
Red Panda.
